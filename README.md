# 📄 Enterprise Document Intelligence Platform

## Overview
This repository documents the architecture and implementation of an
enterprise-grade document intelligence and automation platform.

The platform enables scalable ingestion, AI-based document extraction,
data validation and enrichment, and end-to-end automation of
document-driven business workflows.

The repository focuses on **architecture, orchestration, processing patterns,
and operational readiness**, rather than proprietary implementation details.

## Business Context
Organizations handle large volumes of documents (PDFs, scanned images,
structured and semi-structured files) that traditionally require
manual review and validation.

The goals of this platform were to:
- Reduce manual processing effort
- Improve data accuracy and consistency
- Enable scalable and auditable workflows
- Integrate with existing enterprise systems

---

## My Role
- End-to-end architecture ownership
- Technology and tool selection
- Design and implementation of data orchestration pipelines
- Databricks-based processing logic (Spark / Python)
- Integration of AI-based document extraction services
- Collaboration with infrastructure, security, and business stakeholders

---

## High-Level Architecture
**Core components:**
- Document ingestion layer
- Orchestration using Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Processing and enrichment using Databricks (Spark)
- AI-powered document extraction services
- Structured data storage
- Monitoring, logging, and automation services

## Data Flow (Summary)
1. Documents and metadata are ingested from enterprise sources or APIs
2. ADF orchestrates the end-to-end processing lifecycle
3. Databricks validates, transforms, and enriches extracted data
4. AI services extract structured information from documents
5. Data is stored in structured tables aligned with business models
6. Logging tables capture execution status, errors, and metrics
7. Automation triggers notifications or downstream actions

## CI/CD & Environments
- CI/CD pipelines designed for DEV and TEST
- Parameterized deployments
- Production rollout planned but postponed due to organizational constraints

📦 CI/CD details:
- [`adf/cicd.md`](adf/cicd.md)

---

## Security (High-Level)
- Managed identities for secure access
- Environment separation (DEV / TEST / PROD)
- Configuration-driven pipelines
- Key Vault integration prepared and documented (not activated in this phase)

🔐 Governance and security details:
- [`architecture/security-and-governance.md`](architecture/security-and-governance.md)

---

## Limitations & Future Improvements
- Full CI/CD production lifecycle
- Enhanced observability and alerting
- Advanced document classification
- Human-in-the-loop exception handling

---

## Lessons Learned
- Document intelligence requires strong data engineering foundations
- Clear separation between orchestration and processing is critical
- AI must be tightly coupled with data quality controls
- Early architectural decisions heavily influence production readiness

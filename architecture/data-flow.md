# Data Flow

The platform processes documents through a structured,
end-to-end flow designed for reliability and observability.

1. Documents are ingested from file systems or APIs
2. Metadata is registered for tracking and auditing
3. ADF orchestrates document routing and execution
4. AI services extract structured fields
5. Databricks processes, validates, and enriches the data
6. Results are persisted in structured storage
7. Execution status and errors are logged
8. Notifications and downstream actions are triggered when required
